      <p>
      Hello there! My name is Josh Elrod and I am Full Stack Web-Developer from the North Georgia area. I've worked
        the past 6 years mainly in Shipping/Receiving with some small accounting here and there. I enjoy learning to
        cook Tradional Italian meals for my friends and family. I am HUGE Star Wars nerd! I got into web-development
        because I wanted to push myself in a new direction I've never went before. I am hopeful that the Goergia Tech
        Coding Bootcamp will help me in mastering the different languages used on the internet, as well as helping me a
        career that I enjoy!
